    <title>Understanding Null in JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>In JavaScript, <code>null</code> is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's often used to indicate that a variable or property does not currently have a value assigned to it.</p>

    <p>Here are some key points about <code>null</code> in JavaScript:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type of null:</strong> Despite sometimes being mistaken for an object, <code>null</code> is actually a primitive data type in JavaScript.</li>
        <li><strong>Meaning of null:</strong> It's often used to signify the absence of a value or as an intentional placeholder for a value that may be assigned later.</li>
        <li><strong>Difference from undefined:</strong> While <code>null</code> indicates the absence of a value that has been explicitly assigned, <code>undefined</code> represents the absence of any value in a variable, typically due to not being initialized.</li>
        <li><strong>Type comparison:</strong> When comparing <code>null</code> to other types using strict equality (<code>===</code>), it only equals <code>undefined</code>, but not any other falsy values like <code>0</code>, <code>""</code>, or <code>false</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here's an example to illustrate the difference between <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>:</p>

    <pre><code>
        let x = null;
        let y;

        console.log(x); // Output: null
        console.log(y); // Output: undefined

        console.log(x === null); // Output: true
        console.log(y === undefined); // Output: true

        console.log(x === undefined); // Output: false
        console.log(y === null); // Output: false
    </code></pre>

    <p>Understanding <code>null</code> is important because it allows developers to explicitly signal the absence of a value in their code, which can be crucial for handling different scenarios, such as when retrieving data from a database or when checking for the presence of a certain property.</p>
